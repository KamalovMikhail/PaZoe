# PaZoe: classifying time series with few labels 

This repository provides the reference of new collected dataset (from STMicroelectronics (STM) acquisition
board 'Nucleo G431RB ST L6230 with a GBM2804H brushless motor') and implementation of data prerocessing and PageRank & PCA part of PaZoe framework.
PaZoe is a self-labelling framework shows that graph-based and non-graph based algorithms jointly improve the quality of predictions and outperform each component taken alone.
